# Contributing
Clone repository and run project - it should start out of the box (if it doesn't let me know)

## Git methodology
This project does **not** follow the _Gitflow_ methodology. There is no `develop` branch!
I work with master and feature branches.

I prefer to use fast-forward merges

Branches should be named like: feature/<short_description>


## Code style
Is defined in [.editorconfig](./.editorconfig)
