# Contributing
Clone repository and run project - it should start out of the box (if it doesn't let me know)

## Git methodology
I work with master and feature branches.

I use fast-forward merges

Branches should be named like: feature/<short_description>


## Code style
Is defined in [.editorconfig](./.editorconfig)
